        "\n",
        "If you want to generate some text that is reasonably readable but still surprising, a Markov chain can be a good way to accomplish this. A Markov chain is a kind of [mathematical model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) to describe state transitions, so to apply it to text, we have to think of text a series of probabilistic \"links\" connecting each word to the next. If can calculate the likelihood of _one word_ following _another word_, then we can make a chain starting with that first word and predict the next one.\n",

        "Coding your own Markov chain implementation can be fun, but fortunately, there are already several good implementations in Python modules. In this notebook, I'll be using [Markovify](https://pypi.org/project/markovify/).\n",
